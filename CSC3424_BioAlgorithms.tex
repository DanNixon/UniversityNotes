  \item Protein function sis determined by its amino acid sequence and its three
        dimensional structure

peptide bond between the carboxyl group of one acid and the amino group of
another (giving $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ as a by-product).

\section{Genome Sequencing, Assembly and Annotation}

\subsection{Sequencing}

Reasons for sequencing:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify content and structure
  \item Identify mutations
\end{itemize}

The process of sequencing produces reads. A read is a single continuous sequence
read by the sequencing process.

\subsubsection{Sanger sequencing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Uses DNA polymerase to synthesise DNA

    Enzyme that when given a DNA strand will synthesise the complementary strand

  \item
    A mixture of the polymerase, a primer (small strand of complimentary DNA)
    and deoxynucleotides (DNA nucleotides with fluorescent tag) is made.

  \item
    Products then separated. Multiple methods exist but traditionally using gel
    electrophoresis which allows florescent markers to be seen in four distinct
    "lanes" corresponding to each DNA nucleotide.

  \item
    Accurate but slow

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{454 pyro-sequencing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item High throughput and lower sample preparation time
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Illumina Solexa approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sequencing based on synthesis
  \item Lower cost per sequenced base but high initial cost
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nanopore}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Feed DNA through a pore in a surface and detect nucleotides as they pass
    through

  \item
    Faster with minimal sample preparation

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assembly}

Sequencing produces several fragments of the full genome, in order to obtain the
sequence of the full genome such subsequences must be assembled.

Individual reads are assembled to form contigs. A contig is a group of copied
pieces of DNA representing overlapping regions of a chromosome.

Contigs are assembled to give complete sequences.

\subsubsection{Shotgun sequencing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Long sequences are assembled based on overlaps between several subsequences

  \item
    Region in full sequence should ideally be covered by several subsequences
    to ensure good confidence

    For Sanger sequencing 6 fold redundancy is required

  \item
    Nucleotide at a given position in the final sequence is given by the most
    common nucleotide in the aligned reads/contigs

  \item
    Assembly can be parameterised in terms of number of mismatches between
    aligned reads/contigs allowed at a given point in the final sequence

  \item
    Computationally intensive method: uses naive string searching which becomes
    very slow for large genomes and large number of reads

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{deBruijn assembly}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Split data into a series of small equal length oliomers where oliomers are
    generated by advancing a sliding window along a sequence one nucleotide at a
    time

  \item
    Build a deBruijn graph of all oliomers where edges represent an alignment
    between the two joined oliomers

  \item
    If successful the graph structure will be a single string containing the
    aligned sequence, where the sequence forms an Euclidean path through all
    nodes

  \item
    The choice of the length $k$ of the oliomers is critical to the algorithm
    operating correctly.

    A sub-optimal value of $k$ will cause closed loops in the graph which
    prevents the correct sequence being obtained

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Finishing}

After alignment several gaps may be left in the final sequence, leaving the
result as a series of contigs.

Can be caused by lack of experimental data or issues with the wet experiment,
i.e. AT/GC right regions, homopolymenrs, etc.

Ideal solution is to perform more wet experiments.

\subsubsection{Templates}

When assembling the sequence of a new organism with known relatives the genomic
sequence of the relative can be used to assist positioning of the individual
contigs.

This is done by aligning the contigs to the genomic sequence of the relative.

\subsection{Annotation}

Consensus sequences are analysed to discover features details of which are
stored along with the sequence and the region of the sequence it is relevant to.

Typically a time and resource intensive task in the form of a pipeline of
individual tools used to identify specific features.

\subsubsection{Gene finding}

Open reading frames are a region starting with the initialisation codon
(\texttt{ATG}) and ending in one of three stop codons.

Gene finding can be done using one of two main approaches; comparative genomics
or ab initio.

Comparative genomics uses similarity between regions in a sample and other known
samples to infer the structure of a gene.

Ab initio methods are based on determining gene structure based solely on the
experimental data and known biological theories. External data can be used to
improve prediction accuracy.

Prediction of protein coding genes in bacterial genomes is simple and relatively
accurate. In eukaryotes predicting intron-exon regions is only around 65\%
accurate and non-coding exons can cause issues.

\section{Evolution}

Key relevance is similarity between close evolutionary ancestors which aids
prediction of features such as protein function and structure from a sequence.

\subsection{Mutations}

\Para{Point Mutation}

When a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence changes.

This can have several different effects on the protein sequence:

\begin{description}
  \item[Silent] \hfill \\
    The change in DNA sequence does not change the protein sequence.

    e.g. the mutation \texttt{TTC $\rightarrow$ TTT} gives
    \texttt{Lys $\rightarrow$ Lys}

  \item[Nonsense] \hfill \\
    The change in DNA sequence causes a change in protein sequence that does not
    make sense.

    e.g. the mutation \texttt{TTC $\rightarrow$ ATC} gives
    \texttt{Lys $\rightarrow$ STOP}

  \item[Missense] \hfill \\
    The change in DNA sequence causes a change in protein sequence that is valid
    but may affect the function.

    This can be either conservative in which case the new protein has a similar
    function to the previous or non-conservative in which case the functional
    change is significant.

\end{description}

\Para{Deletion}

Where a section of the sequence is removed.

\Para{Duplication}

Where a section of the sequence is duplicated and inserted after the original
section.

\Para{Inversion}

Where a section of the sequence is reversed in the new sequence.

\Para{Insertion}

Where a section of the sequence of one chromosome is inserted into the sequence
of another chromosome.

\Para{Translocation}

Where two sections of the sequence of two different chromosomes are swapped.

\Para{Frameshift mutations}

Mutations where the relative location of coding information is changed due to
the insertion, deletion or exchange of a subsequence of a different length to
the original.

\subsubsection{Gene duplication}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Evolutionary constraints define the tolerance of how much the gene can
    diverge from its original function after an evolutionary cycle.

  \item
    After gene duplication duplicates have reduced evolutionary constraints as
    the original copy still exists therefore retention of the original function
    is less important.

  \item
    Gene duplication leads to wider divergence in function and evolution of new
    proteins.

  \item
    In bacteria gene duplication can be triggered by external stimuli.

    e.g. temperature, pressure, starvation, etc.

  \item
    In eukaryotes gene duplication is vital for evolution. Around $\frac{1}{3}$
    of a eukaryotic genome consists of duplicates.

  \item
    Duplicate genes with redundant functions can help towards protection against
    deletion mutations.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Homology, orthology and parology}

\begin{description}
  \item[Homology] \hfill \\
    Genes that share a common ancestor.

  \item[Orthology] \hfill \\
    Homologous genes which diverged as a result of speciation.

  \item[Parology] \hfill \\
    Homologous genes within the same genome created as a result of gene
    duplication.

  \item[Xenology] \hfill \\
    Homologous genes where one gene has been obtained through transfer of
    genetic material between organisms.

\end{description}

  \caption{Relationship between homology, orthology and parology}
  \label{fig:homology_orthology_parology}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Homology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Proteins and genes that have diverged from a common ancestor are homologous.

  \item
    Homology is a boolean state, not analogous to sequence similarity.

  \item
    Homology cannot be definitively determined from sequence similarity alone,
    it can however be inferred if the sequences are more than 50\% similar.

  \item
    Homologous proteins often share properties: same/related function, sites,
    structure.

  \item
    As sequences diverge non-conservative mutations increase and the sequence
    similarity to the common ancestor decreases while remaining functionally
    similar, this can make determining homology difficult.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Orthology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Homologous genes from different genomes within the same gene family.

  \item
    Derived as a result of speciation.

  \item
    Often encode proteins that perform the same function in different organisms.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Homologous genes within the same genome within different gene families.

  \item
    May perform different functions in each host due to functional change with
    evolution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Phylogenetics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The study of evolutionary relationships between groups of organisms.

  \item
    Produces hypothesis about evolutionary history of organisms.

    TODO
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Masking}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Separate areas of high similarity from those of low similarity.

  \item
    Areas of high similarity infer homology, low similarity cannot be used to
    infer either way.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Evolutionary model fitting}

Multiple methods:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) (simple)

  \item
    Maximum likelihood (advanced)

  \item
    Bayesian (advanced)

\end{itemize}

\Para{Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Uses distance matrix that tabulates the distance between each pair of
    species.

  \item
    Each iteration merge two closest species and recalculate matrix values based
    on mean of merged species.

  \item
    Repeat until all species are grouped.

  \item
    Order of grouping gives tree structure.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{String based similarity}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Typically not used for biological sequences
  \item Certain changes are more likely to occur as a result of evolution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hamming distance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of positions with mismatching characters in two strings of equal
        length
  \item Lower score denotes similar sequences
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Levenshtein distance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimum number of edits to change one string into another
  \item Lower score denotes similar sequences
  \item A change can be an addition, deletion or substitution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Similarity}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assignment of variable weights to each misalignment
  \item Additive step scores
  \item Gap penalty for areas of no alignment
\end{itemize}

\Para{DNA and RNA}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Typically +1 for match and -1 for mismatch

  \item
    Complex schemes may take into account that a purine-purine or
    pyrimidine-pyrimidine mismatch is more common that a purine-pyrimidine
    mismatch

\end{itemize}

\Para{Proteins}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Learn a matrix of scores based on known amino acid changes during evolution

  \item
    Scores derived from frequency of of amino acid substitutions

  \item
    Data encoded in PAM matrices

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gap penalty}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Penalise gaps in sequence alignment

  \item
    Larger penalty added for opening a gap than extending an already open gap

  \item
    Typical penalties for DNA:

    \begin{description}
      \item[Opening] 10
      \item[Extending] 0.1
    \end{description}

  \item
    Typical penalties for proteins:

    \begin{description}
      \item[Opening] 11
      \item[Extending] 1
    \end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Percent Accepted Mutation (PAM) matrices}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Based on knowledge of evolution

  \item
    Probability of a given change can be determined from alignment of homologous
    sequences

  \item
    Relative frequencies of amino acid changes are encoded in the PAM scoring
    matrix as the probability of mutation to every other amino acid

  \item
    Sample data is restricted to sequences sufficiently similar to ensure
    multiple substitutions have not occurred on the same site

  \item
    A PAM matrix measures sequence divergence

    i.e. a 1 PAM substitution matrix is generated from two sequences that are
    99\% similar

  \item
    To assert similarity of more diverse sequences need matrices for much lower
    sequence similarity

  \item
    Can derive PAM matrices for lower similarity by taking powers of existing
    matrices

  \item
    A range of PAM matrices have been generated in this way and the divergence
    percentage is used in the name of the matrix (e.g. PAM250 denotes expected
    change of 250\%)

  \item
    For use in protein comparison the PAM matrix is first normalised and the
    logarithm taken (known as a log-odds matrix)

    This allows the scores to be added rather than multiplied (as would have had
    to be done with probabilities)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{BLOSSUM matrices}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Multiple alignments of short, continuous (without gaps) sequences are
    arranged into blocks

  \item
    Substitution frequencies for all pairs of amino acids are calculated for
    each block

  \item
    Used in a similar way to PAM matrices to create log-odds scores for amino
    acid substitution

  \item
    Similarity of protein sequences in a block can be adjusted to obtain
    different similarity matrices

  \item
    All BLOSSUM matrices are derived from direct measurements

    i.e. not extrapolated as is done for PAM

  \item
    BLOSSUM allows for detection of more distantly related sequences than PAM
    by reducing the importance of more similar sequences in the block when
    building the matrix

  \item
    BLOSSUM62 (default for many comparison tools) created from blocks where 62\%
    of the amino acids were identical

\end{itemize}
